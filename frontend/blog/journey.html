        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>I never expected TikTok to change my career.</p>
            
            <p>I was scrolling one night, somewhere between the third and fourth time my toddler woke up, when I stumbled across someone talking about AWS cloud engineering. Something about the way they explained infrastructure as code, serverless architectures, and building scalable systems just clicked. I'd spent 15 years in operations and customer service, managing systems and solving problems, but this felt different. This felt like the future I wanted to be part of.</p>
            
            <h2>The Before: Comfortable, But Ready for More</h2>
            
            <p>For over 15 years, I worked in operations and customer service roles. Most recently, I managed CRM systems for a national organization with over 100 chapters across the country. I maintained 99% uptime, handled budgets, coordinated with leadership, and basically kept things running smoothly. It was stable work, and I was good at it.</p>
            
            <p>But as a stay-at-home mom to a toddler who thought sleep was optional, I started learning on the side. My cousin, a software engineer with 15 years at companies like Google, suggested I start with Linux and Python. He even showed me vim, which felt impossible at first but eventually clicked. I didn't have a grand plan. I just wanted to learn something new, keep my brain engaged between diaper changes and endless renditions of "Baby Shark."</p>
            
            <p>Then June 2023 happened.</p>
            
            <h2>The Catalyst: When Stability Disappears</h2>
            
            <p>I got laid off.</p>
            
            <p>Suddenly, I had a decision to make: go back to operations and customer service, or take a real shot at this cloud engineering thing I'd been dabbling in. With a toddler, a mortgage, and exactly zero formal computer science education, the smart move probably would've been to play it safe.</p>
            
            <p>But I couldn't stop thinking about those TikTok videos. About infrastructure as code. About building systems that scale. About solving problems in ways I'd never considered before.</p>
            
            <p>I decided to go all in on AWS cloud.</p>
            
            <h2>The Reality: Learning Between 3 AM Wake-Ups</h2>
            
            <p>Here's what no one tells you about career transitions: they're messy, exhausting, and rarely happen on a convenient timeline.</p>
            
            <p>My study sessions looked like this:</p>
            
            <p>5 AM before my toddler woke up, reading AWS documentation with coffee that never stayed hot. Nap times that might last 30 minutes or 2 hours, frantically working through tutorials and labs. Late nights after multiple wake-ups, debugging Lambda functions while half-asleep. Any quiet moment I could steal to watch course videos or practice on the AWS console.</p>
            
            <p>Financial pressure was constant. Sixteen months unemployed means sixteen months of watching every dollar, calculating if you can afford even the small AWS costs for learning projects, wondering if daycare expenses make sense when you don't have a job yet.</p>
            
            <p>And the rejection. Hundreds of applications, a handful of interviews, zero offers. It wears on you.</p>
            
            <h2>The Action: Building When You Have Nothing But Time</h2>
            
            <p>But unemployment also gave me something valuable: time to actually build.</p>
            
            <p>I started with the Cloud Resume Challenge. Not just following a tutorial, but really understanding what I was building. DynamoDB for the visitor counter, API Gateway for the backend, Lambda functions in Python, S3 for hosting, CloudFront for distribution. Later, I migrated the entire thing to Terraform with OIDC authentication as part of Andrew Brown's Cloud Resume Challenge cohort, forcing myself to learn infrastructure as code properly.</p>
            
            <p>I built a serverless job scraping system because I was tired of spending hours manually searching Indeed and finding almost nothing. Lambda, EventBridge, smart filtering. It solved my actual problem while teaching me event-driven architectures.</p>
            
            <p>Through the Cloud Cozy Discord community led by Shae and Kat, I participated in their DevOps cohort and built projects like an NBA Data Lake using S3, Glue, and Athena, and a Game Day notifications system with SNS. When I felt like giving up, and I felt like giving up often, Shae and Kat's content and the community they built kept me inspired and moving forward.</p>
            
            <p>I also participated in ExamPro's GenAI bootcamp in April 2025, created technical content on Medium and my personal blog at stratajen.net, and engaged in multiple Discord communities. Not just consuming content, but helping other career changers navigate similar transitions.</p>
            
            <p>I took my AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam in October 2025 and scored 707 out of 720. So close. Failing by 13 points after months of study was brutal, but it also showed me I wasn't far off. I'm retaking it January 16th, and this time I'll clear it.</p>
            
            <h2>The Current State: Skilled But Still Fighting</h2>
            
            <p>Today, I have a portfolio of production AWS projects demonstrating real problem-solving. Hands-on expertise in serverless architectures, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipelines. An AWS certification attempt under my belt and a retake scheduled. Active engagement in cloud communities. Technical blog content sharing what I've learned. 600+ unique visitors to my portfolio site.</p>
            
            <p>What I don't have yet: a job.</p>
            
            <p>Sixteen months unemployed. Hundreds of applications to companies like MITRE, Steampunk, SAP, and various startups. Some interviews. No offers yet.</p>
            
            <p>But I'm not the same person who got laid off in June 2023. That person knew operations and customer service. This person builds scalable cloud architectures, writes infrastructure as code, and can debug a Lambda function at 2 AM on three hours of sleep.</p>
            
            <h2>The Lesson: Community and Persistence Beat Perfect Timing</h2>
            
            <p>If I've learned anything from this journey, it's that:</p>
            
            <p><strong>You don't need perfect conditions to start.</strong> I didn't have a CS degree, unlimited time, or a full night's sleep. I had nap times and determination.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Community matters more than you think.</strong> Cloud Cozy, ExamPro cohorts, Discord servers. These weren't just learning resources. They were lifelines when I wanted to quit. Shae and Kat's encouragement, Andrew Brown's teaching, the random strangers in Discord who answered my questions at midnight. They all mattered.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Building real things beats endless tutorials.</strong> I could've spent 16 months just watching videos and doing practice exams. Instead, I built projects that solved actual problems, even if those problems were just mine.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your story doesn't have to look like everyone else's.</strong> I found AWS through TikTok, learned it during a toddler's sleep regressions, and built projects while unemployed and broke. It's not the bootcamp to FAANG story, but it's mine, and it's real.</p>
            
            <p>To anyone else building a new career in stolen moments between life's chaos: you're not alone, and you're not behind. You're exactly where you need to be, learning what you need to learn, at the pace that works for your life.</p>
            
            <p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have an AWS certification exam to pass and a toddler who's demanding snacks.</p>
